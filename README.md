# Google Task:
On this part of the assignment, I used a flexbox, with two flexboxes inside it, to contain the "Recently Visited" images.
This was the most challenging part. I had a hard time getting the images to display in the right location and with the correct size. Eventually, I understood that I needed to place the images inside <div> containers for the css attributes to apply as I intended.
  
# Tic Tac Toe:
The interesting thing I learned on this one is that I could use two words in the "class" field, and apply multiple sections of css code to individual items.
For example, one cell of the table is of the class "Top rightCol"
In css. I made .Top have transparent top borders, and .rightCol have transparent right borders, and these both applied to the class "Top rightCol".
